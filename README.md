# A Dark Year for Tidal Disruption Events

This Mathematica notebook will perform the calculations used in Guillochon & Ramirez-Ruiz 2015 [[2015ApJ...809..166G](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...809..166G)] and MacLeod et al. 2016 [[2016ApJ...819....3M](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...819....3M)] to derive times of circularization, peak, and accretion at peak.
